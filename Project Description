This project is a hands on Security Operations Center home lab that I built to simulate real world monitoring, log ingestion, and detection and response techniques.
The Lab uses Wazuh as a SIEM and Windows and Linux endpoints as well as a Kali Linux machine to simulate an outside attacker.

Environment
- Ubuntu Linux (Wazuh manager and Dashboard)
- Windows Server - Domain Controller
- Windows 10 - User Endpoint
- Kali Linux - Outside Attacker

Telemetry Sources
- Windows Event Logs
Sysmon(Process + Network Telemetry)
Linux syslog
Authentication events

Objective
- Monitor authentication, endpoint activity, and directory changes
- Detect common attacker techniques
- Proactice SOC-style triage and response

Implementation Process
Wazuh SIEM Deployment 
- I began on my Ubuntu machine where I downloaded and configured Wazuh Manager, Indexer, and Dashboard
- I then enrolled Wazuh agents on the Windows Server DC, Windows 10, and Ubuntu machines.
- Resolved agent erollent issues I had like duplicate names and connectivity issues.
- Verified persistent agent connectivity to the manager

Windows Enpoint Telemetry(Sysmon)
- Installed Sysmon on Windows endpoints
- Troubleshot Sysmon configuration to make sure that important events were being logged such as proccess creations and network connections (Event ID1, ID3)
- validated sysmon first locally using wevtutil
- Confirmed Wazuh agent was ingesting Sysmon logs

Current Attack Simulation
- Used Kali Linux to simulate sttacker activity
  - Port scans(Nmap)
  - Connection attempts(SMB, RDP, HTTP) with incorrect credentials to simulate a password spray      attack
- Generated detectable network activity through real TCP connections

Then confirmed that events from endpoints were properly being logged and aggregated at the Wazuh Dashboard


Next Planned Enhancements
- Add custom Wazuh rules to detect common attack vectors
- Noise reduction and alert tuning
- Integration of Suricata for network-based IDS detection
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping for detected activity
- Automation of common response techniques and workflows
